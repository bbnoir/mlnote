the function we find is an estimator of the real function ->  [[Regression Estimator]]
-> larger the number of data is, closer the estimator is

+ Overfitting: Error from var becomes larger as more feature chosen
	+ feature越多，function set越大，var越大(越分散)
+ Underfitting: Error from bias becomes larger as less feature chosen
	+ feature太少，function set可能沒包含true function，產生bias
